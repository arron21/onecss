# onecss
Simple CSS class rules that style specific web elements to match Material Design

````
<table class="onecss-mat-table"></table>

<button class="onecss-mat-button"></button>

<select class="onecss-mat-select">
  <option>I look decent alongside other Material Design elements</option>
</select>
````

turn a standard unstyled web element into an element that matches close to the Material Design Spec.


## Why?
Sometimes the most basic ways are the best
Most frameworks like Angular Material style components that are coupled together with Javascript.
With onecss you can get the same look with just CSS
